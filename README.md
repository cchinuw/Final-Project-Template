The purpose of this research is to see how will surface chlorophyll levels change with temporal and latitudinal variation. It is hypothesized that there will be higher levels of chlorophyll with increasing latitudes, and that there will be higher chlorophyll levels closer to summer months. As hypothesized, chlorophyll concentrations increase with increasing latitudes. This trend is seen in both cruises. The cruise in June (Gradients 2) has higher chlorophyll values, which is much more apparent at higher latitudes. There is a large spike in primary productivity above 40°N. This supports my hypothesis that at higher latitudes, in this range, will have higher chlorophyll values. There is a lot of similarity in chlorophyll values in both of the date ranges until 40°N, indicating that the seasonal changes are more influential the further away from the equator. This makes sense as you move further from the equator that there is more seasonal variability, especially with global solar radiation patterns.
